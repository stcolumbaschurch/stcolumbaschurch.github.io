                <p><strong>Three parishes, one family</strong></p>
                <p>After the success of the Mission of parishioners from Chesham and Great Missenden in Ecuador in August 2018, we were thrilled to receive around 25 young ecuadorian missionaries in our parishes from June 14 to 1st July 2019. Their mission was to come and help us concretely in our parishes.</p>
                <p>Our two parishes came together at IHM to greet and welcome our friends from Ecuador, at the 11:00 am Mass, celebrated by Bishop Peter.</p>      
                <img src="ecuadorgroup.jpg"/>
     
                <p>When our missionaries to Ecuador returned home, they said that, to their surprise, they had received far more from their new friends than they had given. How could we repay their gifts of love and hospitality?</p>
