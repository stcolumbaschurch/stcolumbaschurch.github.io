                <hr />
                <p>Dear Young People,</p>
                <p>
                    We passionately believe that we have a generation of young people
                    who are way ahead of us adults in their desire to make the world a
                    fairer and more loving place.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    At the same time, as we have seen with Greta Thunberg, the world
                    is more ready to hear the voice of young people.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We are hoping to start a group of young advocates who we can work
                    with and empower. The idea is that we will help you to find things
                    you care about, things you&rsquo;d like to change and people you
                    would like to help. We will then help you to use the skills you
                    already have to get your voices heard and act to make a difference.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    We are going to meet just once a month as we know you already have
                    very busy lives. The first meeting will more than likely have to be
                    online but in the future we hope to be able to meet face to face.
                    And, although some of these issues will be serious, we hope we can
                    make a difference in a fun way with our friends.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This group is going to be a group for you and led by you so if you
                    are interested please get permission from your parents and then fill
                    in the following Google Form so that we can contact them. The form
                    can also be found on the Immaculate Heart of Mary (IHM) website and
                    both parish Facebook pages.
                </p>
                <p>We hope to hear from you soon</p>
                <p>Mark Holdsworth & Deacon Peter Collins</p>
