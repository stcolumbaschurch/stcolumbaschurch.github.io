            <p>
                When Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.&nbsp;
                He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him.&nbsp;
                That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word
                and healed all who were sick.&nbsp; This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:&nbsp;
                'He took our illnesses and bore our diseases'.&nbsp; Matthew 8:14-17
            </p>

            <h4>General Prayer for health</h4>
            <p>
                Christ be with me, Christ within me, Christ behind me, Christ before me, Christ beside me,
                Christ to win me, Christ to comfort and restore me,Christ beneath me, Christ above me, Christ in quiet,
                Christ in danger, Christ in hearts of all that love me, Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.
            </p>

            <h4>Prayer for those in authority</h4>
            <p>
                Loving God, in Christ Jesus, the servant of all, you call us to the service of others.
                Grant to those who govern the community the skill to recognise its urgent needs and the
                strength to pursue the common good.&nbsp; Endow us all with patience and courage,
                that we may care for the suffering, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, and sustain the needy.&nbsp;
                Through Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.
            </p>

            <h4>Invocation of Our Lady</h4>
            <p>
                Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection,
                implored your help, or sought your intercession was left unaided.&nbsp; Inspired with this confidence,
                I fly to you, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother.&nbsp; To you I come, before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful.&nbsp;
                O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in your mercy, hear and answer me.<br>Our Lady of Lourdes,
                pray for us.
            </p>

            <h4>Prayer of St Ignatius</h4>
            <p>
                Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory,&nbsp; my understanding, and my entire will,
                all I have and call my own. You have given all to me.&nbsp; To you, Lord, I return it.&nbsp;
                Everything is yours; do with it what you will.&nbsp; Give me only your love and your grace,that is enough for me.
            </p>

            </blockquote>

            <h4>Prayer for the Household</h4>
            <p>
                Hear us, Lord, and send your angel from heaven to visit and protect, to comfort and defend all who
                live in this house.&nbsp; Amen.
            </p>

            <h4>Prayer for Health Staff</h4>
            <p>
                Wondrous God, author of life, you fashioned us in your likeness and
                breathed into us the life which is your own.<br /><br /> Be with those whose special care is the health
                of mind and body.&nbsp; Fill their hearts with awe for the life which is your gift and sustain
                them daily in your service, that their hands may bring to others the comfort of your healing touch&nbsp;
                Through Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.
            </p>

            </blockquote>

            <h4>Prayer for those Affected</h4>
            <p>
                Merciful God, come to the help of your people.&nbsp; Be our shelter in this time of peril and 
                strengthen the bonds of our community.&nbsp; Bring healing to all who suffer the ravages of disease 
                and assist those whose skill and art can put an end to this affliction.&nbsp; 
                Through Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.<br>O God, our refuge and our shield, even when we walk in the 
                shadow of death you are there at our side. Be with your people in this time of danger:&nbsp; 
                Bring strength to the afflicted and protection to those untouched by disease.<br>Give us love and courage, 
                that we may trust in your power to save and reach out to all who need our care&nbsp; 
                Through Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen
            </p>
