            <h4>
                MASS INSIDE CHURCH
                AT IHM AND ST COLUMBA&rsquo;S FROM 6TH SEPT
            </h4>
            <p>
                Mass will be celebrated each Sunday at 10am St Columba&rsquo;s and
                11:30am at IHM.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the Diocesan guidance we will observe a 1.5m + SOCIAL
                DISTANCING POLICY, and observe a strict cleaning and hand sanitising
                regime. The new arrangements limit the capacity inside the Church and
                prior booking is essential.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are in any doubt, concerned or are worried, please do
                continue to celebrate Mass using the livestream facility available.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must book in advance via email
                <a href="mailto:massbookingatihmandstc@gmail.com">massbookingatihmandstc@gmail.com</a>
                or by telephoning the relevant parish office or Keyna at <a href="tel:07866823803">07866823803</a>.
                Bookings must be done by each Thursday 9am to enable the maximum
                attendance in line with the new social distance arrangements and also
                enable communication to confirm your place.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will temporarily retain contact details of who is present in
                case of a localised outbreak and to ensure we adhere to the
                &lsquo;Government Track &amp; Trace scheme&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to attend Mass please do book - places will be
                allocated on a first-come- first-served basis but we will manage the
                process for fairness so everyone who wishes gets a chance to attend
                Mass. Please note you will not be able to make a &ldquo;block
                booking&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a requirement for access for prams/wheelchairs etc or
                other accessibility requirements, please advise at the time of
                booking so we can allocate car parking and make arrangements for you
                to access/leave the Church minimising stairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have not booked and the church is at full capacity, then
                unfortunately you will not be able to attend. We do not want people
                to have wasted journeys if the Church is at capacity and to help the
                volunteer stewards to manage the process easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Face Coverings Next Sunday September 6, Mass will be celebrated
                inside our churches. Face masks are now mandatory inside church for
                the good of everyone else attending.
            </p>
            <h4 >
                WHAT TO DO ON THE DAY
            </h4>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Please do not come to church if you have a high temperature
                    and/or feel unwell.
                </b> The church doors will open 20 minutes before
                Mass is due to begin. A socially distanced queuing system will be in
                operation and there will be signs in place to manage the one-way
                direction/people flow. 1. Wearing a face mask enter the Church, where
                you will be welcomed by a steward who will ask you to sanitise your
                hands and will check your name off the list. You may also have your
                temperature checked prior to entrance. 2. A steward will show you to
                your seat and we ask you to remain there until the conclusion of Mass
                when you will be directed by the steward to Holy Communion or to the
                exit route, which is via the side door. 3. Holy Communion will be
                distributed at the end of Mass in the PALM of the HAND ONLY 4. Please
                sanitise your hands as you leave the church.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that following guidance there will be no access to the
                toilets. If access is required in an emergency please speak to a
                steward who will be wearing yellow tabards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two readers will be required each Mass. They will be contacted
                directly. If you would like to read at Mass please contact the
                relevant parish secretary. Space will be reserved at the front of the
                Church for the readers &amp; any family members.
            </p>
            <hr />

            <p>
                Please note that the Sunday Mass obligation is still suspended, so
                if you wish to attend Mass &amp; can go during the week, that will
                free up the Sunday Mass for those who are working or who have
                families. You may find also that it is quieter. More information on
                weekday Mass will be provided in the newsletter on 6th September
                2020. We recognise that the arrangements for Mass are new with
                booking and limited numbers. These are to minimise risk and ensure a
                safe environment for everyone and we hope to welcome some members of
                the community to Mass inside the Church and be in communion with
                those who are watching the live stream at home.
            </p>
            <h4>
                CAR PARKING for Mass
            </h4>
            <p>
                St Columba&rsquo;s - Space in the car park is very limited and as
                such to manage social distancing and ensure safety, the car park will
                only be available to those who have special needs for access and
                mobility. A car parking space will be confirmed at the time of
                booking.
            </p>
            <p>
                IHM - Please use the Link Road car park.
