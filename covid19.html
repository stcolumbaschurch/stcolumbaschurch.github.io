                An extract from the Guidance for the Celebration

            </h4>
            <p>
                With the easing of restrictions on worship with congregations, we
                tread carefully along the path that lies ahead. Our lives have been
                changed by the experience of the pandemic and it is clear that we
                cannot simply return to how things were before lockdown. We remain
                centred on the Lord Jesus and His command at the Last Supper to &ldquo;do
                this in memory of me.&rdquo; We must now rebuild what it means to be
                Eucharistic communities, holding fast to all that we hold dear, while
                at the same time exploring creative ways to meet changed
                circumstances. It is important to reaffirm that, at present, the
                obligation to attend Sunday Mass remains suspended. A significant
                number of churches may remain closed as they are unable to meet the
                requirements for opening for individual prayer. Fulfilling these
                requirements is a precondition for any church opening after the 4th
                July for the celebration of Mass with a congregation. Please be aware
                that there will be a limit on the number of people who can attend
                Mass in our churches. This will be determined locally in accordance
                with social distancing requirements. We therefore need to reflect
                carefully on how and when we might be able to attend Mass. We cannot
                return immediately to our customary practices. This next step is not,
                in any sense, a moment when we are going &ldquo;back to normal&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />
                <br />

            </p>
            <p>
                The joint working party is focused on ensuring arrangements are in
                place to enable Mass to be celebrated from August outside in the
                garden areas and from September inside the Churches. More information
                will be provided in due course on this page. Our priority remains on
                ensuring everyone&rsquo;s safety.
