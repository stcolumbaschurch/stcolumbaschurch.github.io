                What can Catholics do to protect their mental health during the Coronavirus?

            </h4>
            
            <p>
                A healthy and nourished spiritual life is central to mental health
                and wellbeing. For Catholics, attending Mass on Sundays and during
                the week is a source of mental and spiritual strength, as well as a
                social and community activity. This section will briefly explore some
                ways in which we can keep up a healthy spiritual life during times of
                social distancing and isolation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Public Masses were suspended in England and Wales from Friday 20
                March until further notice. This will be a cause of distress and
                disruption to Catholics, but we are lucky to live in a time when
                technology can be a great help for the development of our spiritual
                lives.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The Catholic Truth Society has put together a helpful list of
                suggestions for several ways in which you can nourish your mental
                health and spiritual life during this time. You can find the full
                list and more information <a href="https://www.ctsbooks.org/if-you-cant-get-to-mass-making-a-spiritual-communion/">here</a>,
                but here are a few key points:

                    <p>
                        <b>Make a Spiritual Communion - </b>Spiritual Communion is
                        the heartfelt desire to receive Our Lord, even when we are unable
                        because of the distance or for some other reason.

                As Catholics, we know the importance of going to Sunday Mass which
                is why the Church tells us that not going is a grave sin. However,
                this does not include those who are physically unable to get to Mass
                through no fault of their own. <b>
                    This means if you are unwell, in
                    self-isolation, or for some other reason you cannot get to Mass, you
                    are not committing a sin because in those instances you are not
                    required to attend Mass.

                </b>Coping with OCD during Coronavirus
            </h4>
            <p>
                Coronavirus will present a unique challenge to those who live with
                OCD, especially in the form of scrupulosity (a form of OCD involving
                religious or moral obsessions). Indeed, the charity OCD Action has
                reported an increase in support requests from people whose fears have
                become focused on the coronavirus pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
                For people with OCD and some types of anxiety, being constantly
                told to wash your hands can be especially difficult to hear. It could
                also be difficult to identify which behaviours are 'acceptable' and
                recommended, and which are driven by the OCD and anxiety.&nbsp;OCD
                Action has published some helpful guidelines about how to manage your
                OCD during this time. The full list and more information can be found
                <a href="https://www.ocdaction.org.uk/articles/covid-19">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scrupulosity is something which Catholic living with OCD might
                struggle with during the coronavirus pandemic. Scrupulous individuals
                are overly concerned that something they thought or did might be a
                sin or other violation of religious or moral doctrine. In particular,
                not being able to attend Mass might be a cause of concern and worry
                for Catholics with OCD. As we stated earlier, it is important to
                remember that you are <u><b>not </b></u>committing a sin by not
                attending Mass during the pandemic. There are many ways in which you
                can maintain a healthy spiritual life, listed above.
            </p>

                At times like this it is of course important to keep up to date
                with health information and advice; however, rolling news is not
                always helpful, and can contribute to mental ill health, including
                feelings of anxiety and depression. Here are some pointers for how to

                        Be active. Great for mind and body.
                        Find ways to keep physically active that are suitable to your ability and circumstances e.g. gardening or home-based exercise

                        Be connected. Know who you
                        need to stay in contact with for help with getting things done or
                        just a general chat; this could include family, friends, local
                        community or faith groups. Find new ways to connect with them such
                        as video calling.

                        Be prepared. Think about what
                        you are going to need and make a plan. You can make daily, weekly,
                        and monthly plans to help get the things you need, e.g food,
                        medicines, magazines.

                        Be in a
                        routine. Develop a new daily routine that
                        works for you, this could include regular waking up and bedtimes,
                        planned mealtimes, and time to be physically active.

                        Be occupied. Now is a great
                        time to get on with your current interests or explore new ones. You
                        could try a hobby that you used to enjoy but haven&rsquo;t had the
                        time for.

                        Be helpful. See how you can
                        support others. Whether it&rsquo;s someone you know or volunteering
                        to support people locally, there are lots of ways to get involved
                        with your community even from home.

                        Be relaxed. Try a relaxation
                        or meditation exercise that works for you and practice it once a day
                        for at least 10 minutes.

                        Be heard. Talk to friends,
                        family or community and faith groups about how you are feeling.
                        Writing things down can help to organise your thoughts. Living
                        through a piece of global history could be a great time to start a
                        diary!

                        Be
                        positive. Try to look for the positives in the situation e.g. having
                        some extra me time or having the opportunity to catch up with
                        something you have been meaning to do.
